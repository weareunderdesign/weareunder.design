# under

welcome to the wild ride that is under, born in the sunny streets of atlit, israel. this handbook is your ticket to understanding our world.

### genesis

under is a creative movement. founded in 2017 by the dynamic duo eden vidal and inbal lapidot vidal, we're all about empowering creatives.  
eden started his journey as a designer and developer, with a passion for connecting the worlds of creativity and technology.  
inbal began as a brand designer, aiming to create remarkable brand identities, studying the edges of design and art.  
over the years, they moved between design studios, several startups, and large companies, launched a few ventures, and accumulated quite a few injuries along the way.  
in 2017, they joined forces to found under. over time, their vision crystallized \- to create tools that empower the creativity of others. we call it meta-creativity, but essentially it simply means that we want to help people and businesses, especially designers, create amazing things.  
our crown jewel is the "brand sprint" \- a mind-blowing process that helps companies stand out in a world drowning in mediocre brands. it's about clarity → precision → impact. it's amazing to see how a simple idea can change the way a group of people work.

### vision

at under, we believe humanity is evolving into a truly interdisciplinary species. we seamlessly integrate and mix design practices through sound, motion, visual design, interaction, and other unexpected fields. by breaking down creative barriers, we can finally craft holistic solutions that engage all senses, pushing the boundaries of innovation to deliver impactful experiences that resonate across all storytelling mediums.  
we believe that the future of digital creation is a place where technology doesn't separate us from our creation but connects us to it more deeply. technology is going to sort of "disappear". and there's an opportunity here to reconnect the creator with their creation, removing the barrier between idea and execution, between intention and result.  
this isn't new territory for us. we've been crafting our own tools since day one, engaging in a perpetual dance of creation and optimization. our journey has always been about developing tools and methodologies that strip away barriers from the creative process itself.  
this approach of building tools for ourselves first is at the core of our philosophy. we create tools that solve our own problems, scratching our own itch. by doing so, we ensure that our products are not just theoretical solutions, but practical tools born out of real needs and experiences.

building for ourselves allows us to:

- deeply understand the problem we're solving  
- create more intuitive and user-friendly solutions  
- iterate quickly based on our own usage and feedback  
- maintain a clear vision and purpose for each product

this self-focused approach doesn't mean we ignore our users. rather, it ensures that our initial product is solid, tested, and truly valuable before we expand to meet wider market needs. it's about creating a strong foundation upon which we can build and grow.  
in rnbw, for example, we blur the line between design and code. because ultimately, there is no real boundary. there is only creation.  
we believe that today's technological tools allow us to blur the boundaries between the creator and the medium. when playing the piano or driving a car, you don't think about the piano \- the person and the piano become one entity. this is exactly what we want and can achieve with our digital tools.  
our latest exciting project, handy, embodies this vision. we aim to use current and future technology to directly connect our hands to our design and development tools. think about it this way: when a sculptor sculpts in stone, he feels the material, he is directly connected to it. there is no separation between his idea and the creation itself. this is exactly what we want to achieve in the digital world.  
with handy, we aim to create a situation where craft will truly be craft. there will be no difference between creating a physical thing and a virtual thing, it will essentially be the same thing. you can touch, feel, create in the digital world as if you were creating in real material.

### values

during this journey, we developed a philosophy that guides us in everything we do. we call it the "holy trinity":

1. simplicity: we're allergic to complexity. whether you're a design newbie or a seasoned pro, our stuff is so intuitive, you'll wonder why you ever struggled before. have fun instantly. like a good musical instrument, our tools need to be intuitive. you pick up a guitar, feel the strings, and start playing. that's how we want using our tools to feel.  
2. complexity: our products are like musical instruments \- they bend and stretch to fit your needs. start small, dream big, and watch our tools grow with you. a good tool adapts itself to the creator, not the other way around. it grows with you, changes with you. it allows you to start as a beginner and become a virtuoso. me, you, or santana, the guitar is the same guitar.  
3. openness: we're as transparent as a freshly cleaned window. most of our stuff is open source and we believe in sharing knowledge. it's not just about open source, it's about an open approach to knowledge, ideas, collaboration. creation, and the creation of creation, is an ongoing dialogue.

and everything it means…

1. real-world impact \- creation without purpose is a tree without roots. let your work solve real problems and nourish real needs.  
2. joyful engagement \- in the garden of creativity, joy is the sunlight. cultivate play, nurture wonder, and watch your ideas bloom.  
3. continuous growth \- the path of mastery has no end. each step, each stumble, is a lesson. embrace the journey of eternal becoming.  
4. community synergy \- a single bamboo does not make a forest. grow together, support each other, and create a canopy of shared wisdom.  
5. tool transcendence \- the brush does not limit the painter. become one with your tools, then move beyond them.  
6. holistic creation \- mind, body, and spirit are not separate streams, but one river. let your creations flow from your whole being.  
7. open exchange \- ideas are seeds that multiply when shared. plant them freely, nurture them collectively, and harvest abundance for all.  
8. adaptive mastery \- be like water, shaping yourself to any vessel. true expertise flows and adapts, never stagnant, always fresh.  
9. purposeful play \- work and play are two sides of the same leaf. find joy in purpose, purpose in joy, and watch your creations flourish.  
10. meta-creativity \- the greatest art is the art of creating. shape not just your work, but the very way you create.

## liberation

at under, we're unlocking the full spectrum of human creativity. we've seen the spark in your eyes when inspiration hits, and the frustration when traditional tools can't capture your vision \- whether it's a visual masterpiece, a symphonic opus, or an interactive experience. that's why we're crafting “liberation” for all creators.  
our tools are the bridge between your imagination and reality, seamlessly blending visuals, sound, motion, and code. with ai as your collaborator and your own body as the interface, we're redefining creative expression and problem solving across all mediums.  
you know the feeling when you create something, but don't share it with anyone. time passes, you get no feedback or motivation, and it turns into a cycle of regret and guilt.

## education

at under, we believe that education is the cornerstone of innovation and creativity. we're committed to fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth, not just within our team, but across the entire creative community. our approach to education is multifaceted, designed to empower creators at every stage of their journey.  
showcase real-world usage: highlight how people (or we) are using our products in creative ways (or embrace the "fake it till you make it" mentality: even if we're still growing, show the potential of our products)

## design in public

building in public means openly sharing our development process, progress, and challenges with our community. through regular updates and milestone celebrations, we engage feedback and build transparency.  
we craft narratives around our products and brand that reflect our essence. we're designing in public, not just building.  
by incorporating user feedback into our development and marketing, we generate interest throughout the product lifecycle.  
this open approach is core to under's values, ensuring our design process remains accessible and collaborative within the open-source community.

## communication

- crafting and maintaining under's unique voice across all platforms  
- developing compelling narratives around our products (rnbw, handy, brand sprint)  
- managing our open-source community engagement and design-in-public initiatives  
- creating content that reflects our core values of simplicity, complexity, and openness  
- building relationships with key media outlets and industry influencers  
- coordinating communication strategies for product launches and company announcements  
- leading our educational content initiatives and knowledge-sharing programs

### content model

we approach content in two ways:

- macro: in-depth content like comprehensive guides, educational series, and thought leadership pieces that establish our expertise  
- micro: bite-sized, engaging content like social media posts, quick tips, and behind-the-scenes glimpses that maintain daily presence

both strategies work together to tell our story and engage our community effectively.  
the garyvee model: document → create → distribute → listen → create → distribute

where creativity thrives and innovation flourishes...  
at under, we've cultivated an environment that seamlessly blends the excitement of a startup with the focus of a creative powerhouse. our workspace is a dynamic fusion of productivity and playfulness, where groundbreaking ideas are born and nurtured.

* we embrace the chaos of remote work \- our partners spans the globe like a digital octopus. find your groove, respect time zones, and your home office setup.  
* four-day workweek madness \- we work sunday to thursday, 9am-6pm. but hey, if inspiration strikes at 3am on a tuesday, who are we to judge? do your best work when you're at your best.  
* communicate and stay active, ask questions, share your crazy ideas. we're all ears (and eyes, in this case).  
* project management: organized chaos \- we use notion to keep our stuff together. update your tasks, make lists (we're list addicts), and remember: a well-organized project is a beautiful project.  
* figma is our digital canvas, and github is where our code comes to life. use 'em, love 'em, make magic happen.  
* feedback: give it, take it, love it \- we thrive on feedback like plants thrive on sunlight. be open, be honest, be kind. remember: iteration is the mother of innovation (or something like that).  
* stay inspired, stay weird \- take time to explore new ideas, experiment, and share what makes your creative juices flow. the weirder, the better.

## launch by lunch

a foolproof, fast-track go-to-market checklist for launching products and services.  
launching a product is like throwing the party of the century \- you need the right mix of hype, substance, and a dash of insanity. here's our recipe:

1. innovation that wows: create something so unique, it makes people's minds explode (in a good way).  
2. storytelling on steroids: craft a narrative that's part fairy tale, part manifesto, all awesome.  
3. visuals that pop: make it so eye-catching, people can't look away.  
4. community buzz: build anticipation and get people excited before the big release.  
5. collab like crazy: partner with the coolest cats in the industry. become unstoppable.  
6. launch party vibes: whether it's online or irl, make some noise\!  
7. press release magic: cook up press releases that are so juicy, journalists can't resist.  
8. aftercare: keep the love flowing with killer support and community engagement.

## talk the talk

at under, our tone of voice and writing style is like that friend who always knows what to say.

- approachable af: we talk like real humans, not robots or boring corporate drones.  
- authentic to the core: we're genuine, passionate, and not afraid to show it.  
- inspiring as heck: we light fires under feet and spark imaginations.  
- share the real stuff from your life. the messier, the better.  
- write like you're chatting with friends. be real, be helpful, be chill.  
- live life, then write about it. stories from experience resonate more than made-up scenarios.  
- emotion is your superpower. make people feel something, seriously\!  
- be positive \- always use positive words or phrases. say what something is, not what it isn't. example: instead of "under isn't just a company \- it's a movement", try "under is a…"  
- share, don't sell. we're about experiences, not transactions.  
- keep it simple. short sentences pack a punch.  
- channel your inner hemingway. if it's complicated, it's probably not ready.  
- rewrite until a 5th grader gets it. your readers will thank you.  
- less is more. make it skimmable. people are busy (including us).  
- commas and periods are your besties. forget the rest.  
- write everything in lowercase. it's our jam. it's approachable and distinctive.  
- keep it visual. let the images and designs speak for themselves.  
- embrace minimalism in stories. clean, tight visuals make a stronger impact than cluttered designs.  
- quality over quantity. fewer, more impactful visuals trump numerous mediocre posts.  
- share others' stories authentically. repost and amplify without adding our own text or elements.  
- think like a visionary. channel the mindset of innovators like neri oxman \- bold, clean, and forward-thinking.  
- be unpredictable. predictable writing fades into the background.  
- headlines are your invitation. make 'em intriguing, make 'em curious.  
- start with a bang. grab attention from word one.  
- sprinkle powerful words throughout your stories.  
- structure is key. use sub-headlines, keep paragraphs short, make it flow.  
- speak from experience, not from a pedestal. we're all learners here.  
- suggest, don't command. inspiration comes from possibility, not authority.

## service provider

* milestones move the project forward, not small tasks.  
* own your milestone: assign yourself, manage issues, and ensure completion.  
* "so there is no 'there is this task that requires me to create another task, and then i’m stuck not making that other task.' instead, there is a 'milestone'—a stone that needs to be moved a mile or so. there may be some bumps along the way, but the focus is on moving the stone, not on every single bump (:"  
* define the milestone, estimate cost (+25-50% buffer if needed).  
* flag major changes but keep moving forward.  
* set a due date, take initiative, and self-manage.  
* if a task spawns another, it’s either part of the milestone or a new one.

### workflow

1. define milestone scope.  
2. assign issues & estimate cost.  
3. set a due date & work towards completion.  
4. flag changes but ensure progress.
