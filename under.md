# under

welcome to the wild ride that is under, born in the sunny streets of atlit, israel.  
this handbook is your ticket to understanding our world.

### genesis

under is a creative movement. founded in 2017 by the dynamic duo eden vidal and inbal lapidot vidal, we're all about empowering creatives.  
eden started his journey as a designer engineer, with a passion for connecting the worlds of creativity and technology.  
inbal began as a brand designer, aiming to create remarkable brand identities, studying the edges of design and art.  
over the years, they moved between design studios, several startups, and large companies, launched a few ventures, and accumulated quite a few successes and injuries along the way.  
in 2017, they founded under. over time, their vision crystallized \- to create tools that empower the creativity of humans. they call it meta-creativity, but essentially it simply means that they want to help humans, (especially those who like to call themselves designers) create amazing things.  
we're know for our "brandsprint" \- a mind-blowing process that helps companies stand out in a world drowning in mediocre brands. it's about clarity → precision → impact. it's amazing to see how a simple idea can change the way a group of people work.

### being

at under, we believe humanity is evolving into a truly interdisciplinary species. we seamlessly integrate and mix design practices through sound, motion, visual design, interaction, and other unexpected fields. by breaking down creative barriers, we can finally craft holistic solutions that engage all senses, pushing the boundaries of innovation to deliver impactful experiences that resonate across all storytelling mediums.  
we believe that the future of digital creation is a place where technology doesn't separate us from our creation but connects us to it more deeply. technology is going to sort of "disappear". and there's an opportunity here to reconnect the creator with their creation, removing the barrier between idea and execution, between intention and result.  
this isn't new territory for us. we've been crafting our own tools since day one, engaging in a perpetual dance of creation and optimization. our journey has always been about developing tools and methodologies that strip away barriers from the creative process itself.  
this approach of building tools for ourselves first is at the core of our philosophy. we create tools that solve our own problems, scratching our own itch. by doing so, we ensure that our products are not just theoretical solutions, but practical tools born out of real needs and experiences.  
building for ourselves allows us to:

* deeply understand the problem we're solving  
* create more intuitive and user-friendly solutions  
* iterate quickly based on our own usage and feedback  
* maintain a clear vision and purpose for each product

this self-focused approach doesn't mean we ignore our users. rather, it ensures that our initial product is solid, tested, and truly valuable before we expand to meet wider market needs. it's about creating a strong foundation upon which we can build and grow.  
in rnbw, for example, we blur the line between design and code. because ultimately, there is no real boundary. there is only creation.  
we believe that today's technological tools allow us to blur the boundaries between the creator and the medium. when playing the piano or driving a car, you don't think about the piano \- the person and the piano become one entity. this is exactly what we want and can achieve with our digital tools.  
our latest exciting project, handy, embodies this vision. we aim to use current and future technology to directly connect our hands to our design and development tools. think about it this way: when a sculptor sculpts in stone, he feels the material, he is directly connected to it. there is no separation between his idea and the creation itself. this is exactly what we want to achieve in the digital world.  
with handy, we aim to create a situation where craft will truly be craft. there will be no difference between creating a physical thing and a virtual thing, it will essentially be the same thing. you can touch, feel, create in the digital world as if you were creating in real material.  
during this journey, we developed a philosophy that guides us in everything we do. we call it the "holy trinity":

#### simplicity

we're allergic to complexity. whether you're a design newbie or a seasoned pro, our stuff is so intuitive, you'll wonder why you ever struggled before. have fun instantly. like a good musical instrument, our tools need to be intuitive. you pick up a guitar, feel the strings, and start playing. that's how we want using our tools to feel.

#### complexity

our products are like musical instruments \- they bend and stretch to fit your needs. start small, dream big, and watch our tools grow with you. a good tool adapts itself to the creator, not the other way around. it grows with you, changes with you. it allows you to start as a beginner and become a virtuoso. me, you, or santana, the guitar is the same guitar.

#### openness

we're as transparent as a freshly cleaned window. most of our stuff is open source and we believe in sharing knowledge. it's not just about open source, it's about an open approach to knowledge, ideas, collaboration. creation, and the creation of creation, is an ongoing dialogue.

in summary, we believe in...

1. real-world impact \- creation without purpose is a tree without roots. let your work solve real problems and nourish real needs.  
2. joyful engagement \- in the garden of creativity, joy is the sunlight. cultivate play, nurture wonder, and watch your ideas bloom.  
3. continuous growth \- the path of mastery has no end. each step, each stumble, is a lesson. embrace the journey of eternal becoming.  
4. community synergy \- a single bamboo does not make a forest. grow together, support each other, and create a canopy of shared wisdom.  
5. tool transcendence \- the brush does not limit the painter. become one with your tools, then move beyond them.  
6. holistic creation \- mind, body, and spirit are not separate streams, but one river. let your creations flow from your whole being.  
7. open exchange \- ideas are seeds that multiply when shared. plant them freely, nurture them collectively, and harvest abundance for all.  
8. adaptive mastery \- be like water, shaping yourself to any vessel. true expertise flows and adapts, never stagnant, always fresh.  
9. purposeful play \- work and play are two sides of the same leaf. find joy in purpose, purpose in joy, and watch your creations flourish.  
10. meta-creativity \- the greatest art is the art of creating. shape not just your work, but the very way you create.

## doing

#### liberating

at under, we're unlocking the full spectrum of human creativity. we've seen the spark in your eyes when inspiration hits, and the frustration when traditional tools can't capture your vision \- whether it's a visual masterpiece, a symphonic opus, or an interactive experience. that's why we're crafting "liberation" for all creators.  
our tools are the bridge between your imagination and reality, seamlessly blending visuals, sound, motion, and code. with ai as your collaborator and your own body as the interface, we're redefining creative expression and problem solving across all mediums.  
you know the feeling when you create something, but don't share it with anyone. time passes, you get no feedback or motivation, and it turns into a cycle of regret and guilt.

#### educating

at under, we believe that education is the cornerstone of innovation and creativity. we're committed to fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth, not just within our team, but across the entire creative community. our approach to education is multifaceted, designed to empower creators at every stage of their journey.  
showcase real-world usage: highlight how people (or we) are using our products in creative ways (or embrace the "fake it till you make it" mentality: even if we're still growing, show the potential of our products)

#### designing in public

building in public means openly sharing our development process, progress, and challenges with our community. through regular updates and milestone celebrations, we engage feedback and build transparency.  
we craft narratives around our products and brand that reflect our essence. we're designing in public, not just building.  
by incorporating user feedback into our development and marketing, we generate interest throughout the product lifecycle.  
this open approach is core to under's values, ensuring our design process remains accessible and collaborative within the open-source community.

## products/services

our products are the embodiment of our vision and philosophy. each one is crafted with care, designed to empower creators and push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm. from our flagship brand sprint process to our cutting-edge tools like rnbw and handy, we're constantly innovating to meet the evolving needs of the creative community.

### content model

we approach content in two ways:

* macro: in-depth content like comprehensive guides, educational series, and thought leadership pieces that establish our expertise  
* micro: bite-sized, engaging content like social media posts, quick tips, and behind-the-scenes glimpses that maintain daily presence

both strategies work together to tell our story and engage our community effectively.  
the garyvee model: document → create → distribute → listen → create → distribute

#### content routines

* newsletter: weekly updates sent to our community, sharing insights, updates, and stories

### talk the talk

at under, our tone of voice and writing style is like that friend who always knows what to say.

* approachable af: we talk like real humans, not robots or boring corporate drones.  
* authentic to the core: we're genuine, passionate, and not afraid to show it.  
* inspiring as heck: we light fires under feet and spark imaginations.  
* share the real stuff from your life. the messier, the better.  
* write like you're chatting with friends. be real, be helpful, be chill.  
* live life, then write about it. stories from experience resonate more than made-up scenarios.  
* emotion is your superpower. make people feel something, seriously\!  
* be positive \- always use positive words or phrases. say what something is, not what it isn't. example: instead of "under isn't just a company \- it's a movement", try "under is a…"  
* share, don't sell. we're about experiences, not transactions.  
* keep it simple. short sentences pack a punch.  
* channel your inner hemingway. if it's complicated, it's probably not ready.  
* rewrite until a 5th grader gets it. your readers will thank you.  
* less is more. make it skimmable. people are busy (including us).  
* commas and periods are your besties. forget the rest.  
* write everything in lowercase. it's our jam. it's approachable and distinctive.  
* keep it visual. let the images and designs speak for themselves.  
* embrace minimalism in stories. clean, tight visuals make a stronger impact than cluttered designs.  
* quality over quantity. fewer, more impactful visuals trump numerous mediocre posts.  
* share others' stories authentically. repost and amplify without adding our own text or elements.  
* think like a visionary. channel the mindset of innovators like neri oxman \- bold, clean, and forward-thinking.  
* be unpredictable. predictable writing fades into the background.  
* headlines are your invitation. make 'em intriguing, make 'em curious.  
* start with a bang. grab attention from word one.  
* sprinkle powerful words throughout your stories.  
* structure is key. use sub-headlines, keep paragraphs short, make it flow.  
* speak from experience, not from a pedestal. we're all learners here.  
* suggest, don't command. inspiration comes from possibility, not authority.

# culture

where creativity thrives and innovation flourishes...  
at under, we've cultivated an environment that seamlessly blends the excitement of a startup with the focus of a creative powerhouse. our workspace is a dynamic fusion of productivity and playfulness, where groundbreaking ideas are born and nurtured.

* we embrace the chaos of remote work \- our partners spans the globe like a digital octopus. find your groove, respect time zones, and your home office setup.  
* four-day sprint madness \- we work monday to thursday, 9am-6pm. but hey, if inspiration strikes at 3am on a tuesday, who are we to judge? do your best work when you're at your best.  
* communicate and stay active, ask questions, share your crazy ideas. we're all ears (and eyes, in this case).  
* feedback: give it, take it, love it \- we thrive on feedback like plants thrive on sunlight. be open, be honest, be kind. remember: iteration is the mother of innovation (or something like that).  
* stay inspired, stay weird \- take time to explore new ideas, experiment, and share what makes your creative juices flow. the weirder, the better.

# make. tell. sell. bell. scale

a foolproof, fast-track go-to-market checklist for launching products and services.  
launching a product is like throwing the party of the century – you need the right mix of hype, substance, and a dash of insanity.  
we follow a "make. tell. sell. bell. scale" method \- means we don't sell what we can't make. we don't produce what we can't sell.  
every product starts with a prototype—designed, tested, and validated. only after sales cover design costs do we scale. no waste. no guesswork. just smart, strategic launches.

here's our recipe:

### 1\. make (v0)

innovate → design something impossible to ignore. if it's not bold, it's not worth making.  
break it down → prototype, refine, and define every spec before selling.  
lead the conversation → publish unique insights, trends, and future predictions.

### 2\. tell (v0.1)

craft the narrative → part manifesto, part magic—make people believe.  
compelling messaging, and storytelling that sticks.  
visuals that pop → stand out. make it so eye-catching, people can't look away. strong visuals. 

### 3\. sell (fomo)

fomo effect → build anticipation → tease, intrigue, and excite before launch. create exclusivity—make it look like everyone wants in.  
exclusive access initiatives → offer beta programs or invite-only opportunities.  
collaborate with the best → team up with key players to amplify reach.  
tag & engage → interact with potential partners, share their work, and start conversations.  
mutual wins → communicate why partnering with under design is a no-brainer.  
social dominance → show up on every relevant platform, engage, and spark conversations.  
guest appearances → feature on industry podcasts, panels, and blogs.

### 4\. bell (v1)

make noise → whether online or irl, turn it into an event.  
press release magic → craft announcements so irresistible, journalists can't ignore.  
big brand collaborations → work with well-known companies to attract others.  
public design challenges → launch interactive projects that invite engagement.

### 5\. scale

highlight traction → showcase real growth, big wins, and social proof.  
leverage partnerships → expand impact with industry leaders and influential brands.  
dm & email outreach → personalized messages that show clear value.  
seo & discoverability → optimize website, blogs, and case studies for inbound interest.  
aftercare → keep the momentum going with community engagement and stellar support.  
get featured → appear in top design, branding, and tech publications.  
press & recognition → win awards, get featured in major media.  
host the conversations → lead panels, roundtables, and exclusive industry talks.  
partner shoutouts → highlight brands we admire to spark new connections.

result: under design becomes a must-collaborate brand. always in front of the right people. always launching. always laughing—at everything, everyone, and even ourselves.

# frmwrk

frmwrk is a… well, framework (\!) designed to deliver outstanding products and services through a smart, efficient, and transparent approach. we integrate automation, clear objectives, and optimized workflows while ensuring simplicity and rapid results.

## sprint → milestone

* milestone must be achievable within 1-3 weeks  
* milestones move the project forward – not small tasks  
* large projects are divided into multiple sprints with breaks  
* focus on outcomes, not time spent.  
* own your milestone: assign yourself, manage issues, ensure completion  
* "instead of getting stuck creating more tasks, focus on moving the milestone forward"  
* define the milestone, estimate cost (+25-50% buffer if needed)  
* if a task creates another, it's either part of the milestone or a new milestone

## daily wrkflw

set up and update daily:

1. create a frame in figma called "📌 tasks" (place it somewhere visible)  
2. inside, outline:  
   * 🟢 to-do → tasks (design \+ ops)  
   * 🟡 in progress → actively worked-on tasks  
   * 🔴 blocked / waiting → approval/info needed  
   * ✅ done → completed tasks  
3. each task is either…  
   * design-related? → link to a figma frame/comment  
   * ops task? → add a note or google doc link

✅ why this works:

* keeps design & ops tasks inside figma without clutter  
* centralized, clear task tracking  
* no scattered comments that get lost

### figma comments \= tasks

* tagged in an open comment? it's your responsibility.  
* open \= to-do | resolved \= done  
* goal: clear all comments to keep projects moving.

### how to work with comments

1. before starting  
   * review all comments in your area.  
   * understand what needs to be done before acting.  
2. making a change  
   * complete the task.  
   * resolve the comment immediately.  
   * if more discussion is needed, open a new comment in the new context.  
3. no backtracking  
   * once resolved, don't reopen unless it's a continuous discussion.  
   * keep the history clean to avoid confusion.  
4. own your work  
   * open comments \= unfinished tasks.  
   * take responsibility—closing comments ensures progress.

bottom line: comments are tasks. handle them efficiently, resolve quickly, and keep moving forward.

## infrastructure & tools

task tracking & workflow automation → figma, github, calendar  
decentralized messaging → whatsapp, email, figma, github  
distributed storage & version control → google drive  
multi-currency payment processing → payoneer, upwork

## pricing model: value-based over hourly

we hire for the job, not forever.  
work takes one week, maybe three—no full-time ties.  
you match our speed, we roll together.  
slow down, we swap you out, keep moving.

* clear objectives → "hourly asks 'how long?', value-based asks 'how well?'"  
* cost control → "hourly fluctuates, value-based locks it down"  
* quality over quantity → "hourly fills time, value-based fulfills objectives"  
* reward for expertise → "hourly pays for presence, value-based rewards skill"  
* motivation to excel → "hourly maintains pace, value-based accelerates impact"  
* career growth → "hourly limits, value-based leverages it"

every project includes:

* clear deliverables, roi expectations, and success metrics  
* a specific timeline (max 3 weeks)  
* a resource allocation plan  
* a results-oriented mindset

### selection criteria for team & projects

* fixed pricing preference  
* remote work capability  
* relevant experience  
* milestone-based payments  
* ip rights protection  
* cancellation terms  
* milestone-based performance metrics

## project evaluation criteria

quality \-\> technical excellence, brand alignment, client satisfaction  
availability \-\> response time, meeting attendance, timezone coverage  
communication \-\> update frequency, documentation quality, stakeholder engagement  
deadlines \-\> deadline compliance, sprint completion rate, milestone accuracy

## sprint phases

1. pre-sprint → scope validation  
2. mid-sprint → progress review  
3. end-sprint → deliverable assessment & satisfaction verification
