            about your past, present, and future. We'll ask why's, how's and

            It’s time to focus on concept development. Set aside some time just

            unique concepts you can build on. Don't worry about being practical
            or realistic right now - focus on exploring the meaning and essence
            of your ideas. This will help you develop creative and inspiring
            concepts to set the stage for a successful project. Happy
            brainstorming!We collect images, textures, typography, and colors to
            portray a different brand experience and commit to one direction we
            all agree about.

            - “a hook is a musical idea, often a short riff, passage, or phrase,
            used in popular music to make a song appealing and to "catch the ear
            of the listener". (Wikipedia). Visual design is music to our eyes,
            and pretty much the same way, a hook is required to catch the
            watcher’s attention. The best brand sprints are where we identify
            this hook and create a visual that focuses the entire brand identity
            around it.

            Your Brand Sprint team must include people with authority and

            how to democratically bring everyone to the table, hear and collect
            all internal thoughts and transform them into actions in the
            decision-making junctions. In most cases, the Champion is the CEO,
            but in some cases, the decider could be another co-founder or CMO.

            final one, but it should be in high fidelity, knowing we'll develop

          <h3>Do you design more than one option?</h3>

            No. Making one amazing idea is harder than creating many different
            ones and picking one. This doesn't make it easy for us, but it gives

            Our process follows a scientific approach. We begin with a story and
            ensure a consistent message. Then, we set anchors and use them to
            question everything daily. The big stuff is discussed in our daily

            The process can be different for each company. It is affected by the
            values and meaning that the logo should represent. Whether the logo
            holds multiple meanings, and which is the most powerful? Whether the
            logo is a symbol or letters, why? The overall shape of the logo:
            literal or abstract? Should the logo be just letters, and how will
            it look in smaller formats? And more...

          <h3>How do you choose colors?</h3>
          <h4>
            We respect colors. Early in the design process, we focus on first
            getting the design to a stable place. We use as few shades of black
            to emphasize function and meaning. Once the design is "getting
            there," we all meet and make a mindful choice. This way, we can see
            how the colors are used throughout the design and ensure we can
            empirically judge color palettes.

          <h3>Who's in Under's Brand Sprint team?</h3>

            We build an oriented brand-sprint team for each sprint, which
            includes ourselves - Inbal (art direction) and Eden (strategy,
            design). There's a designer-illustrator and sometimes an additional
            art director. In addition, there are 2D/3D-Motion artists. We source
            talent worldwide (mainly from Ukraine, India, Europe, and more). We
            do not employ anyone directly, which gives us much flexibility.
            Sometimes we decide we need something particular, so we "go crazy"
            and make some fancy production. We love working with entrepreneurs
            who only have a little free time. who are ready to "give us the
            keys.” Who are entirely "get" the brand sprint benefits as
