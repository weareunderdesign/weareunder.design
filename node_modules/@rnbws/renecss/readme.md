# RenÃ©

RenÃ© is a CSS framework for styling clean, simple, and lightweight interfaces. It is the ultimate common ground for designers & developers. It is based on both native HTML elements and utility classes. It is fully customizable with tokens and themes. And easy syntax to quickly "get it". No weird stuff.
