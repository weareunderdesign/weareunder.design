      <h4>quick and fancy</h4>
      <p>Thu 23 Jul</p>
      <div>
        <p>like everything we do at <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://weareunder.design/"><span>under</span></a>, the brand sprint is an impossible blend of simplicity and flexibility. some
          rules are written with blood, and some are made to adapt to specific needs.</p>
        <p> It all starts with a strategy meeting—a three-hour brainstorming session, as Jake Knapp described in his
          insightful article. We gathered with the team for three hours and learned as much as possible through various
          exercises, such as Simon Sinek's golden circle concept.</p>
        <p>We absorb as much information as we can using sticky notes. After the meeting, we take all the sticky notes
          home and decode what is said. We translate the actual words because, during the meeting, we're not really
          bound by the exact words people use.</p>
        <p>People can express the same idea in different ways, and that's fine. However, after the meeting, I refine
          these expressions at home. I create an accurate map of the 'why', 'what', 'how', etc.</p>
        <p>from there, we can make a story. at this point, we already have a tone of voice - we know how we want to
          sound. there is no visual aspect at this stage, only text. and this is great.</p>
        <p>the team will love it if they feel connected to it and see their contributions. everything they said during
          the strategy sessions is there. on top of what makes a good story, I make sure to include unexpected elements
          and embody the founders’ culture.</p>
        <p>i remember a technical blockchain product in which someone mentioned having fun and buying a yacht. i thought
          it sounded cool and bold. I included this at the end of the story because it was friendly, unique, and
          eventually made sense in their context.</p>
        <p>now, we’re ready for design. the clients bring their company name and content for the homepage. our focus is
          solely on designing and visually communicating this content.</p>
        <p>the homepage, a significant marketing tool, requires a lot of content. it's a storytelling platform, a
          timeline presented on a website. this is our opportunity to create the visual identity and make the brand
          shine.</p>
        <p>The content represents what the client wants to showcase, like features and benefits. This content can be
          delivered to us poorly or well, with the exact words. We always tweak the copy to ensure it matches the
          overall design.</p>
        <p>essentially, we’re creating and testing the brand through a marketing deliverable. this process is a dance.
          we design one thing and then test it. repeat multiple times. from there, we create many other deliverables.
        </p>
        <p>the sprint is a period of rapid work for us and a time for the client to get involved and provide the right
          person to provide the proper feedback - this person is known as the “champion” - the person we engage with the
          most and interact with primarily. we have a daily meeting with them.</p>

        <p>The first part of the process is a bit messy, which isn't necessarily a negative thing. We can call it
          'positive
          scrappiness.' We design things and then throw them into the archive. We evaluate whether we like or dislike
          the
          results, experiencing various emotions.</p>

        <p>we have a method i call a-z, a-b, 1-3 testing. here's how it works:</p>

        <p>We start by creating many logos, aiming for quantity over quality. This might mean making 30 to 40 logos just
          to
          start a discussion. Then, with feedback from the client, we narrow them down to three or four options.</p>

        <p>next, we do a-b testing with these logos, tweaking and comparing different versions. we involve the client
          more
          directly, even if it means showing them works-in-progress. this approach may be too open, but when it works,
          it
          feels more genuine, collaborative, and the truth of how things should be.</p>

        <p>some things are more intuitive and do not require the method, so we skip it.</p>

        <p>another example is choosing the right colors for a brand, which is crucial but tricky. With so many things to
          think about, color stands out because it can significantly impact emotions. colors can shape a brand's vibe,
          and
          it's okay if you cannot figure them out immediately.</p>

        <p>We ran a sprint called “VisionCamp,” and we started with lots of natural, earthy colors to match a camping
          theme. but as we refined our concept to focus more on "vision," we shifted to a bright sky blue that really
          stood out. it ended up capturing the essence perfectly.</p>

        <p>Letting ourselves decide on the main color later allowed us to adapt and find what truly represented our
          vision.
          Starting with a broad theme and narrowing it down, we always re-learn that the best decisions come from the
          journey itself. Believe in the process!</p>

        <p>We commit to a design around day five, typically a Thursday. The weekend provides a brief period for everyone
          to
          reflect on the work. In Israel, we work from Sunday to Thursday, so when Sunday arrives, we have the
          opportunity
          to revisit the design we developed last week.</p>

        <p>We can see the whole picture with fresh eyes and identify the strengths and weaknesses. That's when we start
          to
          bring order to the process. By days seven or eight, we start wrapping up our work in Figma. This is when we
          shift focus from creating and tweaking designs to preparing for the final presentation. Next, we build a
          presentation to showcase how all the pieces we've worked on fit together.</p>

        <p>This isn't just about the homepage we've designed. We want to show how the brand looks in various places,
          like
          billboards and social media. It's our first look at the brand's potential in action.</p>

        <p>the only question is, “is the whole greater than the sum of its parts?”</p>

        <p>Once the presentation is ready, we gather and review it, offering feedback and making adjustments. This part
          of
          the process, which we sometimes extend by a day or two, is called "purify." It's our chance to finalize
          decisions and polish everything.</p>

        <p>After refining our work, we compile the final presentation deck and give it to the client, along with all the
          essential assets they need. We express our thanks and begin the handoff process, and we slowly fade out. Our
          goal is to maintain control over the design quality and ensure a smooth transition at project completion.</p>

        <p>Ideally, by day 11, we've completed everything. The client receives a toolkit, including the final Figma
          file,
          which is an open resource for them.</p>

        <p>even though we aim to work quickly, we don't rush. quality takes time, so our sprints often finish around day
          11
          or 12, sometimes extending to day 13 or 14. during this time, we don't just sit back, we continue to enhance
          the
          brand's cohesion and finalize any remaining design elements.</p>

        <p>Of course, there's a lot more—processes, checklists, emotions, politics—and we’re including it all in the
          upcoming book about facilitating brand sprints. (Basically, this article is the very short version of the
          book.)</p>

        <p>what inspired you to become a designer?</p>
        <p> home was always an atmosphere of creativity: my grandpa was an
          architect, my uncles are musicians, and everyone knew how to draw or
          write beautifully. at home, my grandpa taught me about design
          programs and home planning. outside the house, i was always the one
          drawing and writing signs for youth movements, designing prints on
          shirts, and even tearing out notebook pages because the title didn’t
          come out right.over the years, i was always enchanted by my
          surroundings—i chose books by their covers, looked at signs, and
          thought about what could be done differently and better. in all the
          jobs i worked in before studying design, i always enjoyed the
          creative parts, no matter how small.one day, i saw the phrase “find
          a hobby you love and turn it into your job.” then i realized that in
          the world of design, i can express myself and work in a job that i
          enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>favorite shortcut?</p>
        <p>command+z, and I wish it worked in real life</p>
        <p>who are some of your top design inspirations?</p>
        <p> ‘buck’ studio has been my great inspiration then and now. an amazing combination of many platforms -
          branding, animation, 2d, 3d,
          etc.everything they create is precise, unique, and visually
          stunning, utilizing a variety of techniques. they convey messages in
          their own distinctive way and evoke emotions in every animation
          video. a few years ago, i attended one of their lectures, and it was
          incredible to see the thought processes, planning, and construction
          behind each branding or video project they bring to life.
        </p>
        <p>where do you find inspiration outside of work?</p>
        <p> instagram, of course—almost everything ends up there. books from my
          small home library. wherever i go, whether locally or abroad, i take
          pictures of beautiful and unique things i encounter, like coffee
          packaging, street posters, drink cans, interesting tiles and
          buildings, books, advertisements, and even concerts and
          conversations with people. anything that sparks thought and opens a
          door of inspiration. i can find inspiration in almost anything
          around me; i just need to look up.
        </p>
        <p>what’s your go-to background music or podcast while designing?</p>
        <p> i love listening to almost everything, especially to the radio, so i
          don’t have to bother with transferring songs, and that’s how i
          discover new good songs. but when i need to deeply think about
          branding processes, i listen to calmer songs, mainly from the
          60s-80s.and a tip for old-school music lovers and avengers fans- a
          surprisingly good playlist- “starlord’s playlist”. thank me later.
        </p>
        <p>
          our favorite design trend at the moment?
        </p>
        <p> totally into 3d! any type, anywhere, realistic or amorphic! i’m addicted. in my eyes, it adds another
          dimension to every design,
          adds volume, and provides an opportunity to bring something new and
          different, playing with shapes/textures/lights. its possibilities
          are endless, and you can use it to reproduce everything you want and
          imagine.
        </p>
        <p> i love working with 3d. explore and learning about the many endless
          possibilities it brings.
        </p>
        <p>
          what do you enjoy most about participating in brand sprints?
        </p>
        <p> first of all, from the general idea of ‘brand sprint,’ it’s amazing
          how you can create quick and fancy branding within 10 days. what’s
          great is being able to one hundred percent in the process, without
          distractions and without thoughts about other processes.
        </p>
        <p> building branding captures the mind and the brain, and thinking
          about visual language engages me even after work hours. so it’s
          amazing to find references or think of more directions and bring
          them the next morning without losing momentum.
        </p>
        <p> what’s your favorite part about working with under?
        </p>
        <p> working in a team is the best part of the brand sprint! it’s enriching to see
          how other designers work live, what inspiration they bring, and how they think
          through and crack the brief. additionally, working in an open space (figma)
          allows us to adjust and add to each other’s designs, making them better and
          better, asking questions, and knowing that there are always several designers
          in the background to support and help. moreover, ‘under’ creates an atmosphere
          of confidence and encourages you to bring every sketch and thought, make
          mistakes, and try any direction that comes to mind. this allows you to work
          freely, creatively, and intuitively, getting new ideas and proposing new
          solutions, which makes teamwork in general, and working under ‘under’ in
          particular, so special and good.

      <p>Thu 12 Jun</p>
      <div>
        <p>
          i think, write, design, and code. i design, but i don’t mind what it
          is called. i do things—my things. i've got this dance playing out in
          my head - i'm both idealistic and pragmatic
        </p>
        <p>
          for me, it is all about design. everything is designed, whether
          design practices were used or not. so, for me, everything is either
          lousy design, good design, or remarkable design.
        </p>
        <p>
          but i'm also pragmatic, especially when thinking about problems. i'm
          drawn to complex systems, particularly design tools. i have an
          obsession with tools. tools are fascinating. we shape them, and then
          they shape us. there’s something meta in them that i’ve been drawn
          to since childhood. i'm drawn to things that create things: musical
          instruments, modular things, legos, systems, code, and design tools.
        </p>
        <p>i guess i’m hooked on creativity in a meta way.</p>
        <p>
          meta creativity - a desire to create and empower others to create.
          reflects a deep commitment to transforming and enriching the
          creative process by developing tools, systems, or frameworks that
          enhance or enable it.
        </p>
        <p>how it started</p>
        <p>
          when i met my wife, inbal, we immediately started working together.
          it felt completely natural, considering we were both designers at
          heart. i'm more technological, and inbal is more aestheticist, but i
          can say that we’re both drawn to beauty and practicality.
        </p>
        <p>
          soon enough, we became a design team—a one-stop shop for all things
          design—for a couple of years. we tackled everything: branding,
          product design, and some other crazy projects i don’t even want to
          talk about. before we knew it, we juggled a few projects with a
          multidisciplinary team worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          i can see a pattern in my career. i've always wanted to be a better
          designer. i thought learning programming, illustrating, marketing,
          and meditating—whatever, anything—would make me one.
        </p>
        <p>
          when i took my obsession with design tools one step further and
          created a new design-code tool, i got into the business side of
          things and learned the hard way how crucial it was for improving my
          design game. the more i learned about business and strategy, the
          more i realized we needed to focus on a niche. i started reading
          books and articles to figure out why we were doing things the way we
          were.
        </p>
        <p>also, we had red and negative numbers in our bank account.</p>
        <p>also, we were already parents to two girls.</p>
        <p>also, world pandemic.</p>
        <p>we realized we couldn't take it any longer.</p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          one day, my wife, inbal, said, "<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/"
            target="_blank"><span>i</span></a>
          saw this book you’re reading, something about “design… sprint?”, and
          i wondered, why aren't we doing the same thing for branding?” she
          continued… ”the best brand projects we’ve worked on went quickly,
          often within a week. i would get a great client, a great story, and
          collaborate. these projects were successful because i owned them.
          literally got shit done״.
        </p>
        <p>
          everything clicked for me. i felt that everything i believed in was
          finally coming together.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          that's how
          <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://weareunder.design/brand-sprint"
            target="_blank"><span>brand sprints</span></a>
          were born.
        </p>
        <p>
          this got us thinking we could develop a more defined process, create
          a productized service, and communicate it accordingly to the correct
          type of audience. so, we started doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          we ran our first three sprints for free. it was a new idea we were
          trying out, and when the pandemic hit, it was probably the right
          time to offer it for free!
        </p>
        <p>
          at first, we weren’t sure how to do it right, but kept doing it. we
          knew we had to stick with it, even though it was tough.
        </p>
        <p>
          it wasn’t easy. we received a lot of questions about such a
          controversial topic and even some different job offers, but we stuck
          to our plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          even though it didn’t make much sense then, we kept running sprints.
          we were about making quick and fancy visual identities and
          developing brand stories and strategies. we finally felt we were
          creating something of our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          it clicked with some people and companies. they really liked the
          outputs, they got it, and it felt great. finally, we were doing
          meaningful stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          we started with 10 sprints, then 20, and gradually raised our
          prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          there was a time when we ran sprints one after another. it was
          exciting but really tough. each sprint felt like it took a lot out
          of us. but we kept optimizing.
        </p>
        <p>sprint. rest. repeat</p>
        <p>
          the sprint process is mentally intense and involves processing much
          information. it is not for everyone - designing is an intensive
          process that exercises our mental muscles. we make numerous
          decisions, including many micro-decisions that often go unspoken.
          this applies whether we are hands-on creators, creative directors,
          or simply work with people.
        </p>
        <p>
          i've experienced the strain from constant work, which is why i
          emphasize its importance. find the freedom to do your daily
          activities and work according to your rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          take extended breaks. it's not a marathon. rest and meditation
          between runs are not just beneficial but crucial.
        </p>
        <p>how it’s going</p>
        <p>
          we found a sweet spot that lets us make a profit and hire great
          people to ensure the success of our sprints. now, we can run about
          7-10 sprints a year, and that’s it. we’ve got our well-oiled brand
          sprint machine going.
        </p>
        <p>
          the brand sprints gave us the freedom and privilege to focus more on
          creating our own stuff.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          we’re dreaming (and doing) blending software and hardware
          <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://rnbw.design/" target="_blank"><span>creativity
              tools</span></a>
          for creators, and that's where i'm directing a lot of my and the
          company's energy nowadays, and i believe it has the potential to
          grow into something big.
        </p>
        <p>
          the thought of not running sprints in a few years is okay with me—i
          love what we do, and it's fulfilling. we enjoy the brand sprint
          process and would love to keep doing it, but on a larger scale and
          with an even more exciting type of company.
        </p>
        <p>
          even if we shift away from running sprints, we plan to share our
          knowledge or stay involved in branding somehow. like this evolving
          book and an ai assistant based on it to help others master our
          methods.

          (in the next chapter, we will briefly go through our process. then,
          we will scientifically break down each part in the following
          chapters. see you then)

      <h4>designing for gen z without feeling old</h4>
      <p>Thu 13 Jun</p>
      <div>
        <p>wait, i recognize this</p>
        <p>
          during our research phase, we delved into tons of information about
          gen z, leading us to a fundamental realization. gen z looks up to
          the '90s in the same way that we, as someone who grew up in the
          '90s, looked up to the '60s! we admired the '60s for its primary,
          genuine, and somewhat naive essence. once we located ourselves
          within this admiration for the '90s, everything became clearer. it's
          about technology, but in a primary way - everything was at its
          inception, with a specific visualization and tone of voice.
        </p>
        <p>design choices and visual elements</p>
        <p>
          from vibrant color schemes to bold typography and seamlessly
          integrated visual elements, every aspect of our design was imbued
          with the essence of both nostalgia and modernity. it's this fusion
          that speaks to the heart of gen z, capturing their attention and
          empowering them to embrace their uniqueness. the color schemes,
          typography, and visual elements reflected this aesthetic, striking a
          balance between nostalgia and modernity. the color palette, while
          evoking a sense of nostalgia, remained empowering and inclusive,
          with shades of pink, orange, and red. bold typography served as a
          rebellion against conventional norms, embodying the spirit of
          protest and empowerment synonymous with gen z. illustrations and
          photography were seamlessly integrated, reminiscent of the 90´s
          magazines and wall collages. designing for gen z isn't just about
          aesthetics—it's about understanding, connection, and empowerment.
          it’s about authenticity.
