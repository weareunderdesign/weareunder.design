# ūnderground

welcome to the wild ride that is under, born in the sunny streets of atlit, israel.  
this handbook is your ticket to understanding our world.

### start

under is a creative movement. founded in 2017 by the dynamic duo eden vidal and inbal lapidot vidal, we're all about empowering creatives.  
eden started his journey as a designer engineer, connecting the worlds of creativity and technology.  
inbal began as a brand designer, creating remarkable brand identities and studying the edges of design and art.  
over the years, they moved between design studios, startups, and companies, launching ventures and gathering experience along the way.  
in 2017, they founded under. their vision crystallized - to create tools that empower the creativity of humans. they call it meta-creativity, helping humans (especially designers) create amazing things.  
we're know for our "brandsprint" - a mind-blowing process that helps companies stand out in a world drowning in mediocre brands. it's about clarity → precision → impact. it's amazing to see how a simple idea can change the way a group of people work.

### being

at under, we believe humanity is evolving into an interdisciplinary species. we integrate design practices across sound, motion, visuals, interaction, and beyond. by breaking barriers, we craft holistic solutions that engage all senses and resonate across mediums.  
we see a future where technology connects us more deeply to creation rather than separating us from it. as technology "disappears", we can reconnect creators with their work, removing barriers between idea and execution.  
this isn't new for us. since day one, we've crafted tools and optimized our creative process. our journey focuses on developing methodologies that eliminate barriers to creation.  
building tools for ourselves first is core to our philosophy. we solve our own problems first, ensuring our products are practical solutions born from real experience.  
building for ourselves allows us to:

* understand problems deeply  
* create intuitive solutions  
* iterate quickly  
* maintain clear vision

our self-focused approach ensures solid, tested products before expanding to wider markets, building strong foundations for growth.  
in rnbw, we eliminate the boundary between design and code, recognizing them as one creative act.  
modern tools can merge creator and medium - like a pianist becoming one with their instrument, we enable this unity in digital creation.  
our project handy exemplifies this, connecting hands directly to design tools. just as sculptors feel their material, we want creators to have that same tactile connection in the digital realm.  
with handy, physical and virtual creation become indistinguishable - you'll touch, feel and craft digital work as naturally as physical materials.  
this journey led us to our guiding philosophy, the "holy trinity":

#### simple & complex

we embrace both simplicity and complexity. our tools welcome beginners with intuitive basics - like picking up a guitar for the first time - while offering depths for masters to explore. simple to start, rich with potential, they grow alongside you.

our tools adapt and grow with you, like musical instruments. whether beginner or master, they flex to your needs - me, you, or santana, the guitar remains the same guitar.

- adaptive mastery: like water, we shape our tools to be simple to start yet infinitely deep
- continuous growth: the path of mastery has no end, our tools grow with you
- meta-creativity: we shape not just work, but the very way we create

#### open

we believe in radical transparency. our open source approach extends beyond code to knowledge sharing and collaborative creation. we see creativity as an ongoing dialogue.

- open exchange: ideas multiply when shared freely
- community synergy: we grow stronger together, supporting each other
- joyful engagement: creativity thrives in an environment of play and wonder

## doing

at under, we're not just dreamers - we're doers. our work spans across multiple dimensions of creativity, from brand strategy to tool development. we create tools and methodologies that empower creators, build systems that evolve with their users, and foster a community of innovation and collaboration. here's what keeps us busy.

- holistic creation: unifying mind, body and spirit in the creative process
- purposeful impact: solving real problems and meeting real needs
- tool transcendence: becoming one with our tools to transcend their limitations


#### free

at under, we're unlocking human creativity by bridging the gap between inspiration and execution. we understand the frustration when tools limit your vision, whether visual, musical, or interactive. our tools seamlessly blend all creative mediums, using ai and natural interfaces to redefine expression.  

#### teach

education drives innovation at under. we foster continuous learning within our team and creative community, empowering creators at every stage. we showcase real applications of our products, demonstrating their creative potential even as we grow.

#### design

we openly share our development journey through regular updates and milestones, crafting authentic narratives that reflect our essence. by incorporating community feedback throughout the product lifecycle, we maintain transparency and collaboration at the core of our open-source design process.
we aim to break the isolation of creation - when work goes unshared, motivation fades and regret builds. we're here to change that.

"you're successful as soon as you send your work out into the world."

# culture

where creativity thrives and innovation flourishes...  
at under, we've cultivated an environment that seamlessly blends the excitement of a startup with the focus of a creative powerhouse. our workspace is a dynamic fusion of productivity and playfulness, where groundbreaking ideas are born and nurtured.

* we embrace the chaos of remote work - our partners spans the globe like a digital octopus. find your groove, respect time zones, and your home office setup.  
* four-day sprint madness - we work monday to thursday, 9am-6pm. but hey, if inspiration strikes at 3am on a tuesday, who are we to judge? do your best work when you're at your best.  
* communicate and stay active, ask questions, share your crazy ideas. we're all ears (and eyes, in this case).  
* feedback: give it, take it, love it - we thrive on feedback like plants thrive on sunlight. be open, be honest, be kind. remember: iteration is the mother of innovation (or something like that).  
* stay inspired, stay weird - take time to explore new ideas, experiment, and share what makes your creative juices flow. the weirder, the better.

# launch by lunch

a foolproof, fast-track go-to-market checklist for launching products and services.  
launching a product is like throwing the party of the century – you need the right mix of hype, substance, and a dash of insanity.  
we follow a "make. tell. sell. bell. scale" method - means we don't sell what we can't make. we don't produce what we can't sell.  
every product starts with a prototype—designed, tested, and validated. only after sales cover design costs do we scale. no waste. no guesswork. just smart, strategic launches.

here's our recipe:

### 1\. make

innovate → design something impossible to ignore. if it's not bold, it's not worth making.  
break it down → prototype, refine, and define every spec before selling.  
lead the conversation → publish unique insights, trends, and future predictions.

### 2\. tell

craft the narrative → part manifesto, part magic—make people believe.  
compelling messaging, and storytelling that sticks.  
visuals that pop → stand out. make it so eye-catching, people can't look away. strong visuals. 

### 3\. sell

fomo effect → build anticipation → tease, intrigue, and excite before launch. create exclusivity—make it look like everyone wants in.  
exclusive access initiatives → offer beta programs or invite-only opportunities.  
collaborate with the best → team up with key players to amplify reach.  
tag & engage → interact with potential partners, share their work, and start conversations.  
mutual wins → communicate why partnering with under design is a no-brainer.  
social dominance → show up on every relevant platform, engage, and spark conversations.  
guest appearances → feature on industry podcasts, panels, and blogs.

### 4\. bell

make noise → whether online or irl, turn it into an event.  
press release magic → craft announcements so irresistible, journalists can't ignore.  
big brand collaborations → work with well-known companies to attract others.  
public design challenges → launch interactive projects that invite engagement.

### 5\. scale

highlight traction → showcase real growth, big wins, and social proof.  
leverage partnerships → expand impact with industry leaders and influential brands.  
dm & email outreach → personalized messages that show clear value.  
seo & discoverability → optimize website, blogs, and case studies for inbound interest.  
aftercare → keep the momentum going with community engagement and stellar support.  
get featured → appear in top design, branding, and tech publications.  
press & recognition → win awards, get featured in major media.  
host the conversations → lead panels, roundtables, and exclusive industry talks.  
partner shoutouts → highlight brands we admire to spark new connections.

result: under design becomes a must-collaborate brand. always in front of the right people. always launching. always laughing—at everything, everyone, and even ourselves.

# frmwrk

our framework for delivering exceptional products through three core principles:
* smart automation - let tools do the heavy lifting
* clear goals - know exactly where we're heading
* rapid results - ship fast, learn faster

## principles

* focused 1-3 week sprints with clear deliverables
* value outcomes over hours
* own your milestones: assign, manage, complete
* estimate cost (+25-50% buffer)
* break large projects into manageable sprints
* move forward, not sideways

## workflow

track in figma 📌:
* 🟢 to-do - ready to tackle
* 🟡 in progress - crushing it now
* 🔴 blocked - need help
* ✅ done - shipped it

comments = action items:
* tagged = your responsibility
* open = to-do, resolved = done
* review first, understand, then act
* resolve immediately when complete
* new topic = new comment

## tools

* design → figma
* planning → calendar
* tasks → github
* communication → whatsapp, email
* files → google drive
* payments → payoneer, upwork

## talent

we believe in:
* sprint-based collaboration (1-3 weeks)
* value-based pricing, not hourly
* clear deliverables and fixed timelines
* measurable results and accountability

selection criteria:
* fixed pricing
* remote-ready
* proven expertise
* milestone-based payments
* ip protection
* clear terms

## quality metrics

* technical excellence & brand alignment
* response time & communication clarity
* documentation quality
* deadline adherence
* stakeholder engagement

## sprint rhythm

1. scope → validate vision and plan
2. build → execute with daily progress checks
3. ship → assess deliverables and verify satisfaction

remember: move fast, stay focused, deliver excellence.
