# underground

this handbook is your ticket to understanding our world. it's a living document that captures our philosophy, methods, and vision. as you explore these pages, you'll discover not just what we do, but why and how we do it.

whether you're a team member, collaborator, or curious mind, we invite you to dive deep into the underground - the foundation upon which we build our creative infrastructure.

## under

under is a creative movement founded in 2017 by eden vidal and inbal lapidot vidal, empowering creatives through meta-creativity.
eden started as a designer engineer, connecting creativity and technology.
inbal began as a brand designer, creating remarkable identities and studying design-art edges.
after years across design studios, startups, and companies, they founded under with a crystallized vision - to empower human creativity, especially designers, helping humans create amazing things

they're known for their "brandsprint" - a mind-blowing process that helps companies stand out in a world drowning in mediocre brands. it's about clarity → precision → impact. it's amazing to see how a simple idea can change the way a group of people work.

## being

our philosophy and values guide everything we create and how we work together.

### vision

humanity is evolving into an interdisciplinary species. we integrate design practices across sound, motion, visuals, interaction, and beyond - breaking barriers between mediums and idea-execution to craft holistic solutions that engage all senses.
we see a future where creativity connects us more deeply to our work. as technology "disappears", we reconnect creators through methodologies that eliminate barriers to creation - optimized since day one by solving our own problems first.
this approach allows us to understand problems deeply, create intuitive solutions, iterate quickly, and maintain clear vision.

like water, we shape our offerings to be simple to start yet infinitely deep to master. we welcome beginners with intuitive basics while offering depths for masters to explore - adaptive mastery that grows alongside you. we understand the frustration when limitations restrict your vision, whether visual, musical, or interactive. our approach seamlessly blends all creative mediums, redefining expression through meta-creativity - shaping not just work, but the very way we create.

we embrace the chaos of remote work - our partners span the globe like a digital octopus. we find our groove, respect time zones, and do our best work when we're at our best. we stay inspired and weird.


### values

- design excellence: creating work that transcends expectations - half great beats full mediocre
- move fast, think first: precision, speed, initiative, and taste in execution
- continuous improvement: feedback is direct but never personal - improve, don't defend
- open exchange: ideas multiply when shared freely
- community synergy: we grow stronger together
- joyful engagement: creativity thrives in play and wonder
- holistic creation: unifying mind, body and spirit in the creative process
- purposeful impact: solving real problems and meeting real needs

we foster continuous learning and radical transparency - our open approach extends beyond code to knowledge sharing and collaborative creation. we openly share our development journey, incorporating community feedback to maintain collaboration at our design core.

we aim to break the isolation of creation - when work goes unshared, motivation fades and regret builds. by addressing creative professionals' pain points, under builds a community that feels understood and inspired. when we excite our users, these vocal creatives become enthusiastic advocates, driving organic growth through authentic word-of-mouth.

"you're successful as soon as you send your work out into the world." - rick rubin via twitter (2023)

## echo

we craft and maintain under's unique voice across all platforms, developing compelling narratives around our products and services. we manage community engagement and design-in-public initiatives, creating content that reflects our core values of simplicity, complexity, and openness. we build relationships with key media outlets and industry influencers, coordinate communication strategies for product launches and company announcements, and lead educational content initiatives and knowledge-sharing programs.

we approach content in two ways:

* macro: in-depth content like comprehensive guides, educational series, thought leadership pieces, podcasts, campaigns, and original animated videos that establish our expertise
* micro: bite-sized, engaging content like social media posts, quick tips, behind-the-scenes glimpses, quotes, reels, clips from bigger content, and remixed branded visuals (showcase snapshots, system-based posts, branded frames) that maintain daily presence

both strategies work together to tell our story and engage our community effectively. we follow the cycle: document → create → distribute → listen → create → distribute.

### guidelines

tone
approachable, authentic, inspiring - like that friend who always knows what to say. be genuine and passionate, show emotion, stay positive. build relationships first, sales follow naturally. teach through sharing, suggest don't command.

writing
simple and clear - short sentences, minimal punctuation (periods and commas only), lowercase signature style. make it skimmable with compelling headlines, strong openings, powerful words, clear structure. quality over quantity - fewer, better posts.

visual
personal and mysterious - authentic visuals that intrigue before revealing. clean composition with one strong image, intentional arrangement, purposeful color palette, eye-catching typography. beauty is not optional - aesthetics create emotional connection. timing and rhythm matter.

## rhythm

how we work together - balancing doing and being across daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, and yearly cycles.

### execution

our framework for delivering exceptional products and services:

- smart automation: let tools do the heavy lifting
- clear goals: know exactly where we're heading
- rapid results: ship fast, learn faster
- focused execution: 1-3 week sprints with clear deliverables
- value outcomes over hours
- own your milestones: assign, manage, complete
- move forward, not sideways
- think first, design second: never guess

### modes

we structure our time around two complementary modes:
- doing: focused execution, deep work, output-oriented activities
- being: rest, exploration, learning, connection without specific outcomes

this balance prevents burnout and sustains creativity over the long term.

### daily

doing days (monday - thursday, 9am-6pm)
- morning ritual: 15-min intention setting
- 90-min deep work blocks with 15-min breaks
- end-of-day review: 10-min accomplishment log

being days (friday - saturday)
- no scheduled obligations
- nature connection time
- creative exploration without goals
- social connection and rest

reflection day (sunday)
- morning: review week's progress
- midday: adjust next week's priorities
- afternoon: document learnings and insights

### monthly

doing weeks (weeks 1-3)
- week 1: vision and planning focus
- week 2: deep execution
- week 3: refinement and completion

being and reflecting week (week 4)
- life admin and organization
- skill exploration and learning
- social connections and community
- creative exploration and play
- mindfulness and meditation
- nature immersion
- community contribution
- extended rest and recovery

### seasonal

spring (mar - may): emergence
fresh starts, planting seeds, building momentum
- project initiation
- skill development
- network building
- energy building practices

summer (jun - aug): peak expression
deep work, expansion, peak energy
- major project execution
- public sharing and visibility
- high-energy collaboration
- outdoor activities

fall (sep - nov): integration
harvesting, refining, adjusting, transitioning
- project completion
- knowledge documentation
- relationship deepening
- gratitude practices

winter (dec - feb): restoration
slowing down, reflecting, resting, visioning
- vision boarding
- deep rest
- inner work
- minimal commitments

### yearly

doing phase (january-september)
- q1 (jan-mar): foundation setting
- q2 (apr-jun): growth and expansion
- q3 (jul-sep): peak execution

being phase (october-december)
- october: harvest and celebration
- november: integration and reflection
- december: vision and renewal

balance between doing and being keeps energy sustainable and creativity alive.

### balance

energy over time. quality over quantity. rhythm over rigid schedules. progress over perfection. sustainability over sprints.

transitions:
- do → be: complete open loops, brain dump tasks, reset environment, initiate digital detox, transition activity (walk, meditation)
- be → do: gentle planning, environment prep, priority setting, energy check-in, intention setting

when things shift:
- urgent work in be-time: assess urgency, time-box it, schedule compensation time, adjust systems if it becomes a pattern
- energy dips: check physical needs (sleep, nutrition, movement), adjust work intensity, shift task types to match energy, take micro-breaks

remember: this system serves you, not vice versa. adjust and evolve it based on your experience and needs.
