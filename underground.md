# underground

this handbook captures our philosophy, methods, and vision. it's a living document that reveals not just what we do, but why and how we do it.

whether you're a team member, collaborator, or curious mind - welcome to the underground, the foundation upon which we build our creative infrastructure.

## under

under is a creative movement founded in 2017 by eden vidal and inbal lapidot vidal, empowering creatives through meta-creativity.
eden started as a designer engineer, connecting creativity and technology.
inbal began as a brand designer, creating remarkable identities and studying design-art edges.
after years across design studios, startups, and companies, they founded under with a crystallized vision - to empower human creativity, especially designers, helping humans create amazing things

they're known for their "brandsprint" - a mind-blowing process that helps companies stand out in a world drowning in mediocre brands. it's about clarity → precision → impact. it's amazing to see how a simple idea can change the way a group of people work.

## being

humanity is evolving into an interdisciplinary species. we see a future where creativity connects us more deeply to our work - where design practices flow seamlessly across sound, motion, visuals, interaction, and beyond. we're breaking barriers between mediums and idea-execution to craft holistic solutions that engage all senses.

as technology "disappears", we reconnect creators through methodologies that eliminate barriers to creation. we solve our own problems first, allowing us to understand problems deeply, create intuitive solutions, iterate quickly, and maintain clear vision.

like water, our offerings are simple to start yet infinitely deep to master. we welcome beginners with intuitive basics while offering depths for masters to explore - adaptive mastery that grows alongside you. our approach redefines expression through meta-creativity, shaping not just work, but the very way we create.

what drives us:
- design excellence: creating work that transcends expectations - half great beats full mediocre
- move fast, think first: precision, speed, initiative, and taste in execution
- radical transparency: share openly, improve continuously - feedback is direct but never personal
- open exchange: ideas multiply when shared freely
- community synergy: we grow stronger together
- joyful engagement: creativity thrives in play and wonder
- holistic creation: unifying mind, body and spirit in the creative process
- purposeful impact: solving real problems and meeting real needs

we break the isolation of creation. when work goes unshared, motivation fades and regret builds. by addressing creative professionals' pain points and sharing our development journey openly, we build a community that feels understood and inspired - vocal creatives who become enthusiastic advocates through authentic word-of-mouth.

"you're successful as soon as you send your work out into the world." - rick rubin via twitter (2023)

## echo

we craft under's voice across all platforms through compelling narratives, design-in-public initiatives, and content that reflects our core values. we build relationships with media and influencers, coordinate launches, and lead knowledge-sharing programs.

we approach content in two ways:

macro: comprehensive guides, educational series, thought leadership, campaigns, animated videos that establish expertise
micro: social posts, quick tips, behind-the-scenes, quotes, reels, clips, remixed branded visuals that maintain daily presence

both strategies work together to tell our story and engage our community. we follow the cycle: document → create → distribute → listen → create → distribute.

### guidelines

tone
approachable, authentic, inspiring. be genuine and passionate, show emotion, stay positive. build relationships first, sales follow. teach through sharing, suggest don't command.

writing
simple and clear - short sentences, minimal punctuation, lowercase signature style. make it skimmable with compelling headlines, strong openings, powerful words. quality over quantity - fewer, better posts.

visual
personal and mysterious - authentic visuals that intrigue before revealing. clean composition, intentional arrangement, purposeful color palette, eye-catching typography. beauty is not optional - aesthetics create emotional connection.

## rhythm

how we work together - balancing doing and being across daily, monthly, and yearly cycles.
- doing: focused execution, deep work, output-oriented
- being: rest, exploration, learning, connection without outcomes

we embrace the chaos of remote work - our partners span the globe like a digital octopus. we find our groove, respect time zones, and do our best work when we're at our best. we stay inspired and weird.

### execution

- smart automation: let tools do the heavy lifting
- clear goals: know exactly where we're heading
- rapid results: ship fast, learn faster
- focused execution: 1-3 week sprints with clear deliverables
- value outcomes over hours
- own your milestones: assign, manage, complete
- move forward, not sideways
- think first, design second: never guess

### daily

- morning ritual: 15-min intention setting
- 90-min deep work blocks with 15-min breaks
- end-of-day review: 10-min accomplishment log

being days (friday - saturday)

### balance

energy over time. quality over quantity. rhythm over rigid schedules. progress over perfection. sustainability over sprints.

transitions:
- do → be: complete loops, brain dump, reset environment, digital detox, transition activity (walk, meditation)
- be → do: gentle planning, environment prep, priority setting, energy check-in, intention setting
- urgent work in be-time: assess urgency, time-box it, schedule compensation time
- energy dips: check physical needs (sleep, nutrition, movement), adjust work intensity, take micro-breaks

remember: this system serves you, not vice versa.
