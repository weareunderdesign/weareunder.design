# ūnderground

this handbook is your ticket to understanding our world. it's a living document that captures our philosophy, methods, and vision. as you explore these pages, you'll discover not just what we do, but why and how we do it.

whether you're a team member, collaborator, or curious mind, we invite you to dive deep into the underground - the foundation upon which we build our creative infrastructure.

### start

under is a creative movement. founded in 2017 by the duo eden vidal and inbal lapidot vidal, we're all about empowering creatives.  
eden started his journey as a designer engineer, connecting the worlds of creativity and technology.  
inbal began as a brand designer, creating remarkable brand identities and studying the edges of design and art.  
over the years, they moved between design studios, startups, and companies.
in 2017, they founded under. their vision crystallized - to empower the creativity of humans, especially designers. they call it meta-creativity, helping humans create amazing things.  
they're known for their "brandsprint" - a mind-blowing process that helps companies stand out in a world drowning in mediocre brands. it's about clarity → precision → impact. it's amazing to see how a simple idea can change the way a group of people work.

### being

at under, we believe humanity is evolving into an interdisciplinary species. we integrate design practices across sound, motion, visuals, interaction, and beyond. by breaking barriers, we craft holistic solutions that engage all senses and resonate across mediums.  
we see a future where creativity connects us more deeply to our work rather than separating us from it. as technology "disappears", we can reconnect creators with their work, removing barriers between idea and execution.  
this isn't new for us. since day one, we've optimized our creative process. our journey focuses on developing methodologies that eliminate barriers to creation.  
solving our own problems first is core to our philosophy. we ensure our products and services are practical solutions born from real experience.  
this approach allows us to:

* understand problems deeply  
* create intuitive solutions  
* iterate quickly  
* maintain clear vision

our self-focused approach ensures solid, tested offerings before expanding to wider markets, building strong foundations for growth.  
this journey led us to our guiding philosophy, the "holy trinity":

#### duality

we embrace both simplicity and complexity. our offerings welcome beginners with intuitive basics while offering depths for masters to explore. simple to start, rich with potential, they grow alongside you.

our approach adapts and grows with you, like a well-designed tool. whether beginner or master, it flexes to your needs.

- adaptive mastery: like water, we shape our offerings to be simple to start yet infinitely deep
- continuous growth: the path of mastery has no end, our approach grows with you
- meta-creativity: we shape not just work, but the very way we create

#### open

we believe in radical transparency. our open approach extends beyond code to knowledge sharing and collaborative creation. we see creativity as an ongoing dialogue.

- open exchange: ideas multiply when shared freely
- community synergy: we grow stronger together, supporting each other
- joyful engagement: creativity thrives in an environment of play and wonder

## doing

at under, we're not just dreamers - we're doers. our work spans across multiple dimensions of creativity, from brand strategy to design services. we create methodologies that empower creators, build systems that evolve with their users, and foster a community of innovation and collaboration. here's what keeps us busy.

- holistic creation: unifying mind, body and spirit in the creative process
- purposeful impact: solving real problems and meeting real needs
- design excellence: creating work that transcends expectations


#### liberate

at under, we're unlocking human creativity by bridging the gap between inspiration and execution. we understand the frustration when limitations restrict your vision, whether visual, musical, or interactive. our approach seamlessly blends all creative mediums, redefining expression.  

#### educate

education drives innovation at under. we foster continuous learning within our team and creative community, empowering creators at every stage. we showcase real applications of our work, demonstrating its creative potential even as we grow.

#### design

we openly share our development journey through regular updates and milestones, crafting authentic narratives that reflect our essence. by incorporating community feedback throughout our process, we maintain transparency and collaboration at the core of our design approach.
we aim to break the isolation of creation - when work goes unshared, motivation fades and regret builds. we're here to change that.

"you're successful as soon as you send your work out into the world."

# content

* crafting and maintaining under's unique voice across all platforms  
* developing compelling narratives around our products and services  
* managing our community engagement and design-in-public initiatives  
* creating content that reflects our core values of simplicity, complexity, and openness  
* building relationships with key media outlets and industry influencers  
* coordinating communication strategies for product launches and company announcements  
* leading our educational content initiatives and knowledge-sharing programs

### model

we approach content in two ways:

* macro: in-depth content like comprehensive guides, educational series, thought leadership pieces, podcasts, campaigns, and original animated videos that establish our expertise  
* micro: bite-sized, engaging content like social media posts, quick tips, behind-the-scenes glimpses, quotes, reels, and clips from bigger content that maintain daily presence
* branded generic: when there's no new/macro material, we remix and create graphic elements, system-based posts, and repeated visuals (like showcase snapshots or branded frames)

both strategies work together to tell our story and engage our community effectively.  
the garyvee model: document → create → distribute → listen → create → distribute

### creation

* map out what matters - special drops, sprints, edits worth highlighting
* write a flexible monthly plan structured by week: formats, topics, tone

* once approved - create, schedule, publish

# work

fast. clean. no bullshit.

## environment

we embrace the chaos of remote work - our partners spans the globe like a digital octopus. find your groove, respect time zones, and your home office setup.

four-day sprint madness - we work monday to thursday, 9am-6pm. but hey, if inspiration strikes at 3am on a tuesday, who are we to judge? do your best work when you're at your best.

stay inspired, stay weird - take time to explore new ideas, experiment, and share what makes your creative juices flow. the weirder, the better.

## principles

our framework for delivering exceptional products and services through three core principles:
* smart automation - let tools do the heavy lifting
* clear goals - know exactly where we're heading
* rapid results - ship fast, learn faster

high standards are not optional. "pretty good" isn't good enough. think first. design second. never guess.

* focused 1-3 week sprints with clear deliverables
* value outcomes over hours
* own your milestones: assign, manage, complete
* move forward, not sideways

## process

1. **start**
   - read the brief
   - ask smart questions
   - gather 5 max inspiration references
   - propose a written concept
   - get approval → then design

2. **build** 
   - scope → validate vision and plan
   - build → execute with daily progress checks
   - ship → assess deliverables and verify satisfaction

3. **present**
   - clean figma. proper naming. no mess
   - short explanation: what's the idea? why does it work?
   - always 2 directions. never just one
   - a draft is a thought system, not a moodboard

## workflow

track in figma 📌:
* 🟢 to-do - ready to tackle
* 🟡 in progress - crushing it now
* 🔴 blocked - need help
* ✅ done - shipped it

* design → figma
* planning → calendar
* communication → whatsapp, email
* files → google drive

## delivery

feedback: fast. brutal. clear. never personal. your job: improve, not defend.

final delivery checklist:
* all files clean and organized
* responsive versions included
* proper naming throughout
* final handoff ready-to-go

## rules

* better to ask early than fix later
* half a great idea > full mediocre one
* if taste mismatch → speak up
* no ghosting. no waiting. always update

we measure your work on: precision, speed, initiative, taste, clean execution.

remember: move fast, stay focused, deliver excellence.
