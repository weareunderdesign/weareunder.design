        togetherr approached us to help them develop an identity for a platform
        that will match teams of marketing professionals to brand projects
        worldwide. In other words, it enables creative minds to own their
        creativity. togetherr is the new platform built by Fiverr and leaders in
        the creative industry with a mission to change how brands and creatives
        collaborate. togetherr’s brand speaks first and foremost to creatives,
        people whose enemies are system, complexity, lack of bravery,
        excitement, and time. That’s why their communication is bold and
        straightforward, with no BS. The design toolkit we chose for them is
        limited, but within it, we could go as crazy or as minimal as we need
        to. The identity is based on a black and white color palette and
        Helvetica Now, a new take on a classic font associated with the
        advertising world. We honored it by making it the heart of our visual
        language. The color comes in through the work of the creatives, giving
        them space and respect. We added patterns based on a square that ties
        them with the logo. <br />
