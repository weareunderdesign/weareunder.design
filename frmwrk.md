we leverage strategic resource allocation, smart contracts, and value-based pricing to enable partner success while delivering exceptional client results. our decentralized approach maintains transparency and coordination across projects.

## sprint structure

one-or-two-week sprint cycles

1. projects must be achievable within one or two weeks  
2. large projects divided into multiple sprints with breaks

ðŸ’¡ focus on outcomes rather than time spent

## value-based pricing framework

- clear objectives \- "hourly billing asks 'how long?', value-based pricing asks 'how well?'"  
- cost control \- "hourly billing fluctuates, value-based pricing locks it down"  
- quality over quantity \- "hourly billing fills time, value-based pricing fulfills objectives"  
- reward for expertise \- "hourly billing pays for presence, value-based pricing rewards prowess"  
- motivation to excel \- "hourly billing maintains pace, value-based pricing accelerates impact"  
- career growth \- "hourly billing limits growth, value-based pricing leverages it"

## sprint cycle \- requirements & quality control

1. clear deliverables and success metrics  
2. specific timeline (maximum 2 weeks)  
3. resource allocation plan  
   - selection criteria  
     - results-oriented mindset  
     - fixed pricing preference  
     - remote work capability  
     - relevant experience  
4. roi expectations  
5. smart contract deployment verification  
   - agreement structure  
     - smart contract implementation  
     - milestone-based payments  
     - ip rights protection  
     - cancellation terms  
6. milestone-based performance metrics

| category | evaluation criteria |
| :---- | :---- |
| quality | technical excellence, brand alignment, client satisfaction |
| availability | response time, meeting attendance, timezone coverage |
| communication | update frequency, documentation quality, stakeholder engagement |
| deadlines | deadline compliance, sprint completion rate, milestone accuracy |

7. pre-sprint scope validation  
8. mid-sprint progress review  
9. end-sprint deliverable assessment  
10. satisfaction verification

## service provider

* milestones move the project forward, not small tasks.  
* own your milestone: assign yourself, manage issues, and ensure completion.  
* "so there is no 'there is this task that requires me to create another task, and then iâ€™m stuck not making that other task.' instead, there is a 'milestone'â€”a stone that needs to be moved a mile or so. there may be some bumps along the way, but the focus is on moving the stone, not on every single bump (:"  
* define the milestone, estimate cost (+25-50% buffer if needed).  
* flag major changes but keep moving forward.  
* set a due date, take initiative, and self-manage.  
* if a task spawns another, itâ€™s either part of the milestone or a new one.

### workflow

1. define milestone scope.  
2. assign issues & estimate cost.  
3. set a due date & work towards completion.  
4. flag changes but ensure progress.
